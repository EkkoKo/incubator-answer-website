<!-- -->Also known as expressive knowledge. It is the knowledge that can be formalized, easily articulated, and can be written down or shared in documents and manuals. Explicit knowledge includes: user manuals, case studies, SOPs, etc.
Explicit knowledge is absolute and ready for sharing so that you can share it with confidence.

<!-- -->The knowledge is developed through years of practice, observation, and experience. It is commonly associated with skills, expertise, and "know-how" in various domains, such as craftsmanship, sports, arts, or professional practices.
Implicit knowledge sharing is diverse, since everyone has different approaches to solve the same problem or achieve the same goal.

<!-- -->Tacit knowledge is gained through experience and practice, which makes it hard to articulate or transfer explicitly. It is personal, subjective, and hard to put into words.<br>
<!-- -->Tacit knowledge sharing is through direct interactions, observation, and mentorship.

It requires creating a culture that values collaboration and providing tools for easy exchange of knowledge. Here’s how Answer helps for effective knowledge sharing.</p><ol><li><p>Open and Collaborative Culture<br>
<!-- -->Encourage and value knowledge sharing for everyone on the team. The essence of Answer is open source, and the Q&amp;A platform itself is open and collaborative.

A knowledge base serves as a repository for capturing and preserving institutional knowledge within an organization. It helps to retain critical information even when employees leave or change roles.</p></li><li><p>Consistency and Accuracy
