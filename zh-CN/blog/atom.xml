        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You have to admit that, your customers always have and will ask questions even if your product is perfect. Obviously, not every question needs a team to solve, which makes self-service effective (a support team is still needed). That’s what help center comes for: provide the right information, in a right approach, at the right time for your customers. </p><p>In today’s blog, we will build a help center from the scratch with a bit of community sprit in Answer.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_jb9P" id="whats-a-help-center">What’s a Help Center<a href="#whats-a-help-center" class="hash-link" aria-label="What’s a Help Center的直接链接" title="What’s a Help Center的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>A Help Center serves as a valuable resource for users. It provides customers immediate help by helping them find answers and resolve issues independently.</p><p>When building a help center, here are 2 common questions you need to address:  </p><p><strong>What types of answers or help do users require?</strong><br>
<strong>How can they always get the answers they require?</strong><br>
<strong>How can I maintain and run help center efficiently?</strong></p><p>No worries, we will resolve these problems one by one and build a help center from the scratch together in the coming part of this blog.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_jb9P" id="why-answer-for-a-help-center">Why Answer for a Help Center?<a href="#why-answer-for-a-help-center" class="hash-link" aria-label="Why Answer for a Help Center?的直接链接" title="Why Answer for a Help Center?的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>Here’s how a traditional help center works: users come and seek answers, administrators provide answers constantly, and everything goes over again. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Traditional Help Center" src="/zh-CN/assets/images/HowHelpCenterWorks-2c656867ecc3e74a7b2451825bd16f33.png" width="1818" height="874" class="img_QRbK"></p><p>As the content in the help center becomes abundant, things change. For users, finding the correct answer can be challenging. Similarly, administrators face the pressure of maintaining, and running an effective help center.</p><p>However, in Answer, everything is entirely different from traditional help center.
In Answer, <strong>everyone can ask and respond</strong>, creating a mutual way interaction. Every user can ask a question, contribute, vote for an answer, etc. Here, the user is no longer waiting for answers passively, but becomes a part of help center management. This also alleviates the pressure of administrators, allowing them to focus on the roadmap of the help center.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_jb9P" id="build-a-help-center-with-answer-tutorials-and-tips">Build a Help Center with Answer (Tutorials and Tips)<a href="#build-a-help-center-with-answer-tutorials-and-tips" class="hash-link" aria-label="Build a Help Center with Answer (Tutorials and Tips)的直接链接" title="Build a Help Center with Answer (Tutorials and Tips)的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>The essence of a help center is to provide the right answer to the problems occurring already, and Answer is born for this. Here’s how, and you’ll know why.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_jb9P" id="01-start-with-the-faqs">01.

It not only makes sure your content is right for the help center, but also solves the most common issues for your customers at the moment.</p><p>The best part in Answer is that, as long as you run a support center with it, gradually you’ll get the FAQ at present because your customers have done it for you ;)</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Hot Question in Answer" src="/zh-CN/assets/images/HotQuestion-ef67ffdab6d52bb688402904a7fb9f19.png" width="2400" height="911" class="img_QRbK"></p><p>You can also <a href="https://answer.dev/blog/2023/05/11/answer-1.0.9-release#whats-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pin recent FAQs</a> for your customers, or add as an additional resource in the sidebar, so that users can get the answer they need right away.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Pin an FAQ in Answer" src="/zh-CN/assets/images/Pin-8e1d1995537cee48a87fcf6ddc0cd39c.png" width="787" height="299" class="img_QRbK"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_jb9P" id="02-make-content-consistent">02.

Customers can also write answers to others, then admin and moderator will read and accept the best answers. If the question is answered perfectly in content, but not consistent with your style guide, you can have an admin or moderator to tune and make it looks shining again.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Approved Answer" src="/zh-CN/assets/images/ApprovedAnswer-ba49dc086762005556e29c2257350c19.png" width="2400" height="840" class="img_QRbK"></p><p>There are tips and notice to assist users deliver a concise question, while keeping the help center neat, such as tips for a clear title, format guidance, tag notes, etc.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Tips and Notice in Answer" src="/zh-CN/assets/images/TipsandNotice-83f10e51e511b10a8da326365d0572d3.png" width="2400" height="1519" class="img_QRbK"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_jb9P" id="03-organize-categories-with-tags">03.

In fact, you must use one of them for sure since a knowledge base takes various forms, such as databases, wikis, documents, articles, FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions), manuals, tutorials, or any other structured or unstructured format.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_jb9P" id="why-you-need-it">Why You Need it<a href="#why-you-need-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Why You Need it的直接链接" title="Why You Need it的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>We expect to retrieve the right information at the moment, and the process must be quick.

By having a knowledge base in place, employees can find the information they require without relying on others or spending excessive time searching for it. This increases productivity and efficiency in performing tasks by empowering users to find information independently.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge Retention and Sharing
A knowledge base serves as a repository for capturing and preserving institutional knowledge within an organization. It helps to retain critical information even when employees leave or change roles.</p></li><li><p>Consistency and Accuracy
With a knowledge base, organizations can ensure consistency and accuracy in the information. It minimizes errors and conflicts, allowing for standardized procedures, guidelines, and documentation, reducing the risk of errors or inconsistencies caused by outdated or conflicting information.</p></li><li><p>Customer Self-service and Support
Knowledge bases are commonly used in <a href="/zh-CN/blog/2023/07/05/how-to-build-a-help-center-with-your-users-and-answer">customer support</a> to provide self-service options. By offering a comprehensive collection of FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and instructional materials, customers can find solutions to their problems without the need to contact support, reducing support costs and improving customer satisfaction.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_jb9P" id="build-knowledge-base-with-answer">Build Knowledge Base with Answer<a href="#build-knowledge-base-with-answer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Build Knowledge Base with Answer的直接链接" title="Build Knowledge Base with Answer的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>Make sure you have the right tools for hosting and managing your knowledge base.
