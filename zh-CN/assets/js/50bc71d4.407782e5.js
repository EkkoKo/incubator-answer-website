Obviously, not every question needs a team to solve, which makes self-service effective (a support team is still needed). That\u2019s what help center comes for: provide the right information, in a right approach, at the right time for your customers. \\n\\nIn today\u2019s blog, we will build a help center from the scratch with a bit of community sprit in Answer.\\n\\n## What\u2019s a Help Center\\nA Help Center serves as a valuable resource for users. It provides customers immediate help by helping them find answers and resolve issues independently.\\n\\nWhen building a help center, here are 2 common questions you need to address:  \\n\\n**What types of answers or help do users require?**       \\n**How can they always get the answers they require?**          \\n**How can I maintain and run help center efficiently?**\\n\\nNo worries, we will resolve these problems one by one and build a help center from the scratch together in the coming part of this blog.\\n\\n\\n## Why Answer for a Help Center?\\nHere\u2019s how a traditional help center works: users come and seek answers, administrators provide answers constantly, and everything goes over again. \\n\\n![Traditional Help Center](HowHelpCenterWorks.png)\\n\\nAs the content in the help center becomes abundant, things change. For users, finding the correct answer can be challenging. Similarly, administrators face the pressure of maintaining, and running an effective help center.\\n\\nHowever, in Answer, everything is entirely different from traditional help center.\\nIn Answer, **everyone can ask and respond**, creating a mutual way interaction. Every user can ask a question, contribute, vote for an answer, etc. Here, the user is no longer waiting for answers passively, but becomes a part of help center management. This also alleviates the pressure of administrators, allowing them to focus on the roadmap of the help center.\\n\\n## Build a Help Center with Answer (Tutorials and Tips)\\nThe essence of a help center is to provide the right answer to the problems occurring already, and Answer is born for this. Here\u2019s how, and you\u2019ll know why.\\n\\n### 01. Start with the FAQs\\nIt\u2019s hard to immediately categorize questions in the beginning, why not start with the frequently asked questions? It not only makes sure your content is right for the help center, but also solves the most common issues for your customers at the moment.\\n\\nThe best part in Answer is that, as long as you run a support center with it, gradually you\u2019ll get the FAQ at present because your customers have done it for you ;)\\n\\n![Hot Question in Answer](HotQuestion.png)\\n\\nYou can also [Pin recent FAQs](https://answer.dev/blog/2023/05/11/answer-1.0.9-release#whats-new) for your customers, or add as an additional resource in the sidebar, so that users can get the answer they need right away.\\n\\n![Pin an FAQ in Answer](Pin.png)\\n\\n### 02. Make Content Consistent \\nIn Answer, help center is not just about self-service, but also about helping each other. Customers can also write answers to others, then admin and moderator will read and accept the best answers. If the question is answered perfectly in content, but not consistent with your style guide, you can have an admin or moderator to tune and make it looks shining again.\\n\\n![Approved Answer](ApprovedAnswer.png)\\n\\nThere are tips and notice to assist users deliver a concise question, while keeping the help center neat, such as tips for a clear title, format guidance, tag notes, etc.\\n\\n![Tips and Notice in Answer](TipsandNotice.png)\\n\\n### 03.

In Answer, you can create new tags freely: add one in the Tag page, or build a new one right after a post.\\n\\n![Categorize with Tags in Answer](CategorizewithTags.png)\\n\\nAdd a description for your users to know what the tag is about, and what content can they find in this tag. Users can click to view all the related information they require. With filter, they can find the content in the way they want.\\n\\n![Tag and Description in Answer](TagandDescription.png)\\n\\n### 04. Keep the Answers Fresh and Ready\\nDon\u2019t make your help center end up with outdated answers. Though users are actively becoming a part of the community, moderators still need regular review and edit. Keep an eye on product launch, tweaks and updates, and you\u2019ll notice how effective tags can be when updating the content.\\n\\nWhen updating or editing a post, use [Unlist](https://answer.dev/blog/2023/05/11/answer-1.0.9-release#whats-new) to hide the post temporarily to avoid misunderstanding. \\n\\n![Unlist a Question in Answer](UnlistQuestion.gif)\\n\\n### 05. Make Sure Users Can Access Answers Easily\\nAnswer provides various ways for users to access the content they are searching for. Besides browsing in the help center, users can also get answers in the following ways:\\n\\n1.

Effective knowledge sharing increases productivity, and enhances collaboration within your team. \\n\\nAnswer was inspired by the inherent openness of Q&A platforms and communities. As the team behind Answer, we appreciate and embody the spirit of knowledge sharing when tuning Answer. \\n\\nIn this blog, we will explore types of knowledge, ways of knowledge sharing, and strategies to improve knowledge sharing for your team with Answer.\\n\\n## What is Knowledge Sharing? \\n[![Knowledge Sharing](knowledgesharing1.jpeg)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/140596819595429978/)\\n\\n[Knowledge Sharing\xa0Comic by Dilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_sharing)is an activity through which knowledge (namely, information, skills, or expertise) is exchanged among people, friends, peers, families, communities, or within or between organizations. \\n\\nAnswer is a platform for knowledge sharing, and the form of asking and answering is a natural way of knowledge sharing. The information in Answer can be documented for every user to check. Admins can modify them for keeping them up-to-date. \\n\\n## 3 Types and Ways of Knowledge Sharing\\n01. Explicit Knowledge          \\n\\tAlso known as expressive knowledge. It is the knowledge that can be formalized, easily articulated, and can be written down or shared in documents and manuals. Explicit knowledge includes: user manuals, case studies, SOPs, etc.\\n\\tExplicit knowledge is absolute and ready for sharing so that you can share it with confidence. \\n   ![Explicit Knowledge](knowledgesharing2.png)\\n\\n02. Implicit Knowledge            \\n\\tThe knowledge is developed through years of practice, observation, and experience. It is commonly associated with skills, expertise, and \\"know-how\\" in various domains, such as craftsmanship, sports, arts, or professional practices. \\n\\tImplicit knowledge sharing is diverse, since everyone has different approaches to solve the same problem or achieve the same goal.\\n    ![Implicit Knowledge](knowledgesharing3.png)\\n\\n03. Tacit Knowledge                \\n\\tTacit knowledge is gained through experience and practice, which makes it hard to articulate or transfer explicitly. It is personal, subjective, and hard to put into words.   \\n\\tTacit knowledge sharing is through direct interactions, observation, and mentorship. \\n   ![Tacit Knowledge](knowledgesharing4.png)\\n\\n## Effective Knowledge Sharing with Answer\\nNo matter which type of knowledge your company or team has, it never goes wrong to capture, store and share them effectively for everyone on the team. \\n\\nEffective knowledge sharing involves sharing information, expertise, and insights. It requires creating a culture that values collaboration and providing tools for easy exchange of knowledge. Here\u2019s how Answer helps for effective knowledge sharing.\\n\\n1. Open and Collaborative Culture       \\n\\tEncourage and value knowledge sharing for everyone on the team. The essence of Answer is open source, and the Q&A platform itself is open and collaborative. \\n\\tIn Answer, you can customize the layout and add rules in the sidebar to remind everyone subtly.\\n\\t![Customize Right Sidebar](knowledgesharing5.png)\\n\\tYou can also pin the welcome post that includes regulations, values, and spirit of your platform, ensuring new members can see the post as soon as they join your community, while helping community members to check.   \\n\\t![Alt text](knowledgesharing6.png)\\n\\t \\n2. Make Knowledge Accessible         \\n\\tIn Answer, sharing and accessing to knowledge is like breathing. Everyone is a loop of knowledge sharing: add a question, provide answer, upvote, etc. This fosters a collaborative spirit for the community naturally.\\n\\t![Answer a Question](knowledgesharing7.png)\\n\\t  \\n\\tAdmin can also add wikis, FAQ for users in the sidebar to provide relevant knowledge.\\n\\t![Customize Left Sidebar](knowledgesharing8.png)\\n\\n3. Effective Knowledge Management  \\n\\tBesides knowledge storage, and creation, knowledge management is the key that keeps your platform running. In Answer, you can manage different types of knowledge by tags. You can find tags are like troops, guarding each question so that you can identify the category you need immediately.\\n\\t![Tags with Post](knowledgesharing9.png)\\n\\tManaging tags is also easy. Admins can add, edit or remove a tag in one place.\\n\\t![Manage Tags](knowledgesharing10.png)\\n4. Recognition and Rewards          \\n\\tExpress gratitude to the contributors and experts.   \\n\\tIn Answer, we\u2019ve automated the [reputation system](https://answer.dev/docs/recipes/contents/reputation), encouraging ownership and motivation to share valuable insights. Users can earn reputation scores by asking questions that everyone concerns, receiving votes from other users, answers accepted. It\u2019s a reflection of how active you are in the community. With more reputation scores, you\u2019ll unlock more features, such as upvote, invite an answer, edit other\u2019s question, etc.\\n\\n5. Feedback and Evaluation  \\n\\tEncouraging feedback loops and continuous improvement for your community. Once you\'ve obtained a sufficient reputation score, you can start voting for questions or answers, providing feedback to enhance its quality and relevance.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nUnderstand three types of knowledge and find an effective way to share in the team.
