# FAQ
## Why can't I receive the registration email?

You should configure you own SMTP address in the admin setting interface.

## How do I switch the default language?

- Admin can switch the default language in the admin setting interface.
- Users can switch languages in their own settings interface.

## What are the currently supported database types? Is migration supported?

We support `MySQL` `PostgreSQL`  `SQLite3`. Unfortunately, we **do not** currently support data migration.
So we recommend using SQLite3 **just for the experience** and MySQL for actual use.
